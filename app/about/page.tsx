                    A curve, your curve, NORDKURVE12! Under this principle, as an independent umbrella organization of active Bayer 04 fans, we are committed to the concerns and interests of our fan scene. And it's not just about the 90 minutes in the stadium on match day or the journey to the away games, which we organize for you at fan-friendly prices. Because fan culture is by no means limited to supporting the team in the curve, but is lived out every day and we offer you the opportunity to take part in it intensively.<br /><br />

                    Just in time for the 2008/09 season, parallel to the stadium renovation, an organizational change within the fan scene was also underway - a real milestone, as it turned out over time. In order to combine forces even more, the organizers and members of the then “Fan Initiative SVB” decided from now on to operate together with the Ultras Leverkusen under the umbrella of NORDKURVE12 eV. The fan initiative was therefore dissolved as a registered association, while the UL from then on no longer acted as an umbrella organization, but reorganized itself into a pure ultra group with a closed membership system. The goals of NORDKURVE12 are, on the one hand, to strengthen the feeling of togetherness within the fan scene, as well as to unify the fan scene in order to speak one language to the club and to be able to represent fan interests well. <br /><br />

                    We regularly offer you events such as parties and football tournaments, such as the annual Ulrich Haberland Cup, as well as other diverse leisure activities. In our club restaurant Stadioneck12 there are regular cultural events, such as readings, lectures and film screenings, but there is also plenty of fun with various theme parties, live football broadcasts or table football and shock tournaments. We thus promote a sense of belonging within the fan scene and offer younger fans in particular the opportunity to make social contacts, integrate into the fan scene and get involved there. <br /><br />

                    We see ourselves as the mouthpiece of our members and, at the same time, the mouthpiece of the entire Leverkusen fan scene. We have been able to develop and consolidate this status over time in our role as a serious discussion partner for the club and many institutions related to football events in Leverkusen and beyond. All of this is only possible with strong support from our members. Do you also want to be a part of this community, do you care about fan culture and don't just want to consume the game, but also help shape fan culture yourself and stand up for everything that is important to us as football fans? Then you too can become a member of NK12! It concerns us all! For 19.04 euros per year, you can join us too. A curve, your curve, NORDKURVE12 <br /><br />
